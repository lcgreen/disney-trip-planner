# Sounds Directory

This directory contains audio files for the Disney Countdown Timer application.

## Missing Files

The application expects the following sound file:
- `disney-chime.mp3` - A Disney-themed chime sound that plays when the countdown reaches zero

## Adding the Sound File

To add the missing sound file:

1. Obtain a Disney-themed chime sound in MP3 format
2. Name it `disney-chime.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory

## Fallback Behavior

If the sound file is missing, the application will:
- Log a warning message to the console
- Continue functioning normally without playing the completion sound
- Not crash or show errors to the user

## Alternative Solutions

If you don't have a Disney chime sound, you can:
1. Use any royalty-free chime sound and rename it to `disney-chime.mp3`
2. Disable sound in the countdown settings
3. Replace the audio element with a different sound file

The application gracefully handles missing sound files, so it will work even without this file.
