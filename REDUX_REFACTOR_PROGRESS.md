## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress  
**Date**: [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Update test setup to support Redux
- [x] Create Redux test utilities (`src/test/testUtils.tsx`)
- [x] Verify Redux Provider integration works
- [x] Create basic Redux setup tests
- [x] Migrate CountdownTimer tests to Redux (`src/test/ReduxCountdownTimer.test.tsx`)
- [x] Migrate BudgetWidget tests to Redux (`src/test/ReduxBudgetWidget.test.tsx`)
- [x] Migrate PackingChecklist tests to Redux (`src/test/ReduxPackingSlice.test.tsx`)
- [x] Migrate TripPlanner tests to Redux (`src/test/ReduxTripPlannerSlice.test.tsx`)
- [x] Create Redux-based dashboard tests (`src/test/ReduxDashboard.test.tsx`)
- [x] **Fix user state mismatch between sidebar and dashboard** - Updated all components to use `useReduxUser`
- [x] **Fix SSR localStorage error** - Added proper browser environment checks to prevent localStorage access during server-side rendering

### Current Task:
- [ ] Optimize selectors for better performance (address memoization warnings)
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Final cleanup and documentation

### **User State Mismatch Fix** âœ… COMPLETED
**Problem**: Sidebar showed "Premium" user level while dashboard showed "Anonymous", preventing widget addition.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent use of user state hooks:
- Navigation component used old `useUser` hook
- Dashboard component used new `useReduxUser` hook

**Solution**: Updated all components to consistently use `useReduxUser`:
- [x] Navigation component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
- [x] BudgetWidget component (`src/components/widgets/BudgetWidget.tsx`)
- [x] PackingWidget component (`src/components/widgets/PackingWidget.tsx`)
- [x] TripPlannerWidget component (`src/components/widgets/TripPlannerWidget.tsx`)
- [x] TripPlanner component (`src/components/TripPlanner.tsx`)
- [x] PluginPageWrapper component (`src/components/common/PluginPageWrapper.tsx`)
- [x] FeatureGuard component (`src/components/FeatureGuard.tsx`)
- [x] PluginHeader component (`src/components/ui/PluginHeader.tsx`)
- [x] UserProfile component (`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`)
- [x] Budget new page (`src/app/budget/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Planner new page (`src/app/planner/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Packing new page (`src/app/packing/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Test user levels page (`src/app/test-user-levels/page.tsx`)

**Result**: âœ… User state now consistent across all components, "Add Widget" button works correctly.

### **SSR localStorage Fix** âœ… COMPLETED
**Problem**: `localStorage is not defined` error during server-side rendering (SSR).

**Root Cause**: Storage middleware was trying to access localStorage during SSR where it's not available.

**Solution**: Added proper SSR checks to storage middleware:
- [x] Added `isBrowser` helper function to check for browser environment
- [x] Added SSR check in `loadInitialState()` function
- [x] Fixed state structure to match actual type definitions
- [x] Removed non-existent `autoSaveStatus` properties

**Files Updated**:
- [x] `src/store/middleware/storageMiddleware.ts` - Added SSR checks and fixed state structure

**Result**: âœ… Application loads without SSR errors, localStorage only accessed in browser environment.

### **User State Loading Fix** âœ… COMPLETED
**Problem**: Premium user showing as anonymous on dashboard despite correct user data in localStorage.

**Root Cause**: Storage middleware was saving the entire user state object (`state.user`) but loading it back as just the user data, causing structure mismatch.

**Solution**: Fixed user state saving and loading in storage middleware:
- [x] Changed saving to store only `state.user.currentUser` instead of entire state
- [x] Updated loading to properly reconstruct user state object
- [x] Added debugging logs to track user state operations

**Files Updated**:
- [x] `src/store/middleware/storageMiddleware.ts` - Fixed user state saving/loading structure
- [x] `clear-localStorage.js` - Created helper script to clear old data format

**Result**: âœ… User state now loads correctly, premium users show as premium on dashboard.

### **CountdownTimer Saving Fix** âœ… COMPLETED
**Problem**: CountdownTimer had issues with saving functionality while PackingChecklist worked correctly.

**Root Cause**: CountdownTimer was missing the `setCanSave` callback implementation and proper ref pattern that PackingChecklist uses.

**Solution**: Applied the same saving pattern as PackingChecklist:
- [x] Added `setCanSave` callback implementation with proper change detection
- [x] Added `useImperativeHandle` hook for ref-based saving
- [x] Converted component to use `forwardRef` pattern
- [x] Added proper data change tracking and parent notification

**Files Updated**:
- [x] `src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx` - Added saving pattern from PackingChecklist

**Result**: âœ… CountdownTimer now saves correctly with the same reliable pattern as PackingChecklist.

All major Redux slice/component tests are now passing, confirming the migration is robust and complete for core widgets.

### User State Mismatch Fix âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Date**: [Current Date]

**Issue**: The sidebar (Navigation component) was showing "Premium" user level while the dashboard was showing "Anonymous" user level, preventing users from adding widgets.

**Root Cause**: The Navigation component was using the old `useUser` hook while the Dashboard was using the new `useReduxUser` hook, creating a state mismatch.

**Solution**: Updated all components to consistently use `useReduxUser`:
- [x] Navigation component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
- [x] BudgetWidget component (`src/components/widgets/BudgetWidget.tsx`)
- [x] PackingWidget component (`src/components/widgets/PackingWidget.tsx`)
- [x] TripPlannerWidget component (`src/components/widgets/TripPlannerWidget.tsx`)
- [x] TripPlanner component (`src/components/TripPlanner.tsx`)
- [x] PluginPageWrapper component (`src/components/common/PluginPageWrapper.tsx`)
- [x] FeatureGuard component (`src/components/FeatureGuard.tsx`)
- [x] PluginHeader component (`src/components/ui/PluginHeader.tsx`)
- [x] UserProfile component (`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`)
- [x] Budget new page (`src/app/budget/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Planner new page (`src/app/planner/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Packing new page (`src/app/packing/new/page.tsx`)
- [x] Test user levels page (`src/app/test-user-levels/page.tsx`)

**Result**: All components now use the same Redux-based user state, ensuring consistent user level display and functionality across the entire application.

- [ ] Migrate remaining existing tests to use Redux Provider
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for Redux functionality
